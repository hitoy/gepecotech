# GEP ECOTECH Collaborates with Leading Public Company on Fiber-Reinforced Plastics Co-Processing Project

In Shandong, China, GEP ECOTECH has partnered with a publicly listed company to explore the use of waste fiber-reinforced plastics (FRP) as an alternative fuel for cement kilns. GEP ECOTECH provided the company with a dual-stage shredding system to break down FRP products into approximately 5cm pieces, which are then fed into rotary kilns.

"This is our company's first venture into fiber-reinforced plastics waste disposal. After researching the technological capabilities of various domestic and international suppliers, we chose GEP ECOTECH based on the quality and performance of their equipment, their experience, their delivery and after-sales service capabilities, and their competitive pricing," said project leader Lu.

"We engaged in multiple rounds of discussions with the client to fully understand their requirements. Our team worked diligently to provide a tailored solution that meets their specific needs and ensures efficient processing of the FRP materials," said a representative from GEP ECOTECH.

Fiber-reinforced plastics are widely used materials known for their strength and durability. However, their disposal poses significant challenges due to their complex composition. By utilizing GEP ECOTECH's advanced shredding technology, the partnership aims to turn these waste materials into valuable alternative fuels, thereby reducing environmental impact and promoting sustainable resource management.
