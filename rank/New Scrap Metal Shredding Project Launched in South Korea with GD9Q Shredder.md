# New Scrap Metal Shredding Project Launched in South Korea with GD9Q Shredder

GEP ECOTECH has announced that its [GD9Q dual-shaft shredder](https://www.aishred.com/product/double-shaft-shredder.html) has been officially put into operation by a prominent South Korean metal recycling company. This marks a significant advancement in the company's efforts to promote efficient and sustainable metal recycling.

The South Korean customer, a leading player in the metal recycling industry, processes a diverse array of scrap metals, including copper-clad laminates, circuit boards, copper-coated steel waste, and copper shavings. The GD9Q shredder, designed for high shearing force and durability, reduces these materials to pieces approximately 10 cm in size for further processing.

GEP ECOTECH's technical team provided robust support during the installation process, ensuring a seamless and efficient setup. "Our technical team worked closely with the customer to ensure a smooth and efficient setup," said Ethan, the project's executive director. "The successful deployment of the GD9Q shredder underscores our commitment to delivering reliable and high-performance solutions."

This project adds to the growing list of successful metal recycling initiatives executed by GEP ECOTECH. Amidst the current global economic downturn, where many environmental projects dependent on government investments or subsidies face delays or cancellations, metal recycling remains a lucrative and vital investment area. Metal recycling not only helps mitigate resource shortages but also significantly reduces environmental pollution, making it an essential component of sustainability efforts in the industry.

GEP ECOTECH offers a range of specialized shredders tailored to different pre-processing needs, including [pre-shredders](https://www.aishred.com/product/pre-shredder.html), [shear shredders](https://www.aishred.com/tag/rotary-shear-shredder/), and [large single-shaft shredders](https://www.aishred.com/product/single-shaft-shredder.html).
