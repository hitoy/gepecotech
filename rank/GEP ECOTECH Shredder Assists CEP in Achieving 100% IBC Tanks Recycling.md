# GEP ECOTECH Shredder Assists CEP in Achieving 100% IBC Tanks Recycling

CEP has launched a hazardous waste treatment line with an annual capacity of around 8,000 tons in Nanyang, a city in central China. The facility is designed to recycle IBC containers, iron oil drums, paint buckets, and other storage containers for chemical liquids. The entire recycling process includes shredding, washing, and co-processing in cement kilns.

Unlike general solid waste, hazardous waste can pose risks such as toxic and harmful substance leaks, or even combustion and explosions during recycling. Therefore, hazardous waste must be treated with specialized systems.

Due to budget constraints and the low risk of material leakage, this project did not use GEP ECOTECH’s [enclosed shredding system](https://www.aishred.com/product/closed-shredding-system.html). Instead, it employs a conveyor system combined with a [GD series shear shredder](https://www.aishred.com/product/double-shaft-shredder.html), using a hopper to receive shredded materials, which are then transported by a loader to the next processing stage.

"This project involves processing various containers. During the pilot phase, we found that many suppliers' equipment could not effectively handle the materials. Once the materials entered the crushing chamber, they kept rolling on top and couldn’t be efficiently crushed, failing to meet the capacity requirements. GEP ECOTECH's products are different; their shredders, specifically designed for container crushing, solved this issue perfectly. We quickly reached a cooperation agreement," said Ma, the project manager.

CEP Environmental Co., Ltd., jointly invested by CITIC Industrial Fund, Kangwei Group, and Zijin Mining, is a leading enterprise in hazardous waste treatment and recycling in China.

This is not GEP ECOTECH’s first collaboration with CEP, nor is it their first venture into the hazardous waste disposal sector. GEP ECOTECH’s [hazardous waste pre-treatment solutions](https://www.aishred.com/application/hazardous-waste-processing.html) are dedicated to providing robust and reliable environments for hazardous waste disposal enterprises, fully integrating with various upstream and downstream facilities, enhancing safety and efficiency, reducing risks, and achieving 100% harmless disposal.
