# GEP ECOTECH Biomass Shredders Accelerate Green Power Production in the Philippines

In Negros, Philippines, [San Carlos BioPower](https://www.thomas-lloyd.com/en/project/san-carlos-biopower), [North Negros BioPower](https://www.thomas-lloyd.com/en/project/north-negros-biopower), and [South Negros BioPower](https://www.thomas-lloyd.com/en/project/south-negros-biopower), three biomass power plants with a combined capacity of 75 MW, have simultaneously commenced operations, benefiting over 300,000 residents.

These biomass power plants, all funded by the ThomasLloyd Group, exclusively use locally produced sugarcane planting and processing waste, as well as small amounts of grass and woody materials, as fuel.

Unlike conventional coal or gas power plants, biomass power plants use biomass as fuel to generate steam, which then drives turbines. The carbon in this fuel comes from plant photosynthesis, making it a renewable resource that reduces greenhouse gas emissions by over 500,000 tons annually.

To ensure a continuous supply of suitable fuel for the boilers, GEP ECOTECH provided five large [GDB13Q biomass shredders](https://www.aishred.com/tag/biomass-shredder/) and [fuel supply systems](https://www.aishred.com/application/biomass-waste-processing.html), specially customized to handle high-volume and continuous operation requirements for bundled materials.

"The project has been running smoothly for over four years now, and the client has been extremely satisfied with our equipment," said Shan Yufeng, the project installation manager. "We have received numerous additional orders for blades and other components during this period."
