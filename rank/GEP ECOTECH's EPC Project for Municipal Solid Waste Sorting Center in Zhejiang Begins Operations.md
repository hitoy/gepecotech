# GEP ECOTECH's EPC Project for Municipal Solid Waste Sorting Center in Zhejiang Begins Operations

In Zhejiang, an economically developed province in southern China, GEP ECOTECH has delivered an EPC (Engineering, Procurement, and Construction) project for a municipal waste sorting center located in a local bonded zone. The center processes solid waste generated in the area, sorts valuable materials for recycling, and converts combustible materials into RDF (Refuse-Derived Fuel) pellets.

This high-priority project, funded and operated by a state-owned enterprise, is designed to process 200,000 tons of solid waste annually, significantly alleviating the increasing pressure of urban waste disposal in the region. GEP ECOTECH provided the comprehensive design and installation services for the project.

“This project attracted bids from several renowned domestic and international manufacturers. Our proposal and equipment scored high marks across all evaluation criteria, demonstrating the expert panel’s unanimous recognition of our capabilities. We will continue to work closely with our client to ensure the successful implementation of the project,” said Chen Binwei, Sales Director, upon learning of the successful bid.

“This is the first large-scale municipal solid waste project we’ve undertaken in Zhejiang Province. We made thorough preparations, carefully studied the client’s site conditions, and maintained close communication with the owner and civil engineering parties. We developed a scientific and comprehensive installation plan and dispatched our most experienced engineering team to ensure the timely completion of the installation and commissioning targets,” stated Wang Chunyang, Manager of the After-Sales and Installation Services Department, after the project's successful trial run.

Municipal solid waste is currently one of the largest and fastest-growing types of waste, with the most complex composition. Traditional landfill methods occupy land space and risk soil and groundwater contamination. Constructing incineration centers requires substantial investment and may face operational issues due to insufficient waste volumes. GEP ECOTECH’s [msw resource recovery solution](https://www.aishred.com/application/municipal-solid-waste-processing.html) converts municipal waste into fuel, enabling the flexible use of existing incineration plants and rotary kilns. This approach minimizes redundant investments and resource waste.
