# GEP ECOTECH Helps North America’s Largest Aluminum Company Expand Scrap Aluminum Recycling Capacity

"Our shredding and sorting production line is an integral part of the entire scrap aluminum recycling process. By shredding and sorting, we can reduce the size of large scrap materials, making it easier to separate iron, copper, and other metals and impurities from the aluminum. This enhances the purity of the aluminum ingots," said James, Sales Manager. "Smaller scrap sizes also help reduce energy consumption during melting, lower greenhouse gas emissions, and save on fuel and carbon emission quotas."

Aluminum is one of the most widely used consumer metals globally. It can be recycled repeatedly without losing any of its properties. Compared to extracting aluminum from ore, recycling aluminum saves more than 90% of the energy, making it one of the most scalable and profitable directions in the recycling industry.

"This project is part of the company’s green initiative, aimed at achieving its ambitious carbon reduction goals. After multiple rounds of negotiations and discussions, all technical details were finalized. The installation work is currently underway, and we expect the production line to be operational soon," James added.
