# GEP ECOTECH's TDF Production Plan Continues to Provide Power Fuel for Macau

GEP ECOTECH has provided the Macau Waste Incineration Center with a production line that processes scrap tires into Tire-Derived Fuel (TDF) at a rate of 3 tons per hour. This project is part of the third phase expansion of the Macau Waste Incineration Center, which includes a municipal solid waste treatment plant with a daily capacity of 1,300 tons and facilities for handling special and hazardous waste. The center is expected to supply Macau with 400 million kWh of alternative fuel annually.

Like Refuse-Derived Fuel (RDF) and Solid Recovered Fuel (SRF), TDF is a type of derived fuel with a calorific value similar to that of coal. It is one of the key methods for recycling waste tires. Other recycling methods include producing rubber mulch, rubber granules, rubber powder, or through pyrolysis.

TDF can be used as fuel in industrial boilers or rotary kilns. When burned, it leaves very little bottom ash. When incinerated in cement kilns, the metal elements in the ash can serve as a substitute for clinker raw materials, enhancing the quality of the cement.

"The equipment used in their third phase expansion are all from top international brands, with very strict quality control. Our equipment being part of this project not only signifies the client's recognition of our products but also demonstrates that our product quality has reached international standards," said Wang Chunyang, the project installation manager.
